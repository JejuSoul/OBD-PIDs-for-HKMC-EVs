# OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs
OBD PIDs for Hyundai/Kia/Motor/Company Electric Vehicles.
Currently the Hyundai Ioniq Electric, Kia Ray EV and Kia Soul EV

## How to use:
These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets.
The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. [How to use Torque with a Hyundai / Kia EV](https://jejusoul.github.io/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/)

## What hardware do I need?
Almost all users are using a Bluetooth Diagnostic Scanner connected to an android phone ot tablet running Torque Pro.
We recommend the Konnwei KW902. See - [recommended obd2 adapter](http://www.mykiasoulev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=711)

## I am IOS user. How can I use PIDs?
Try Engine Link and a LELink - Bluetooth Low Energy OBDII Adapter.
No one has yet tested that this works.

## I am Windows phone user. How can I use PIDs?
Try Car Scanner Pro and a OBDLink MX Bluetooth
One user has tested this and has stated it is mostly working.

## What is OBD? What is PID?
OBD is On-Board_Diagnostics. By connecting directly to the car we have access to the status of various vehicle subsystems.
PIDs are the Parameter IDs; these are the codes used to request data from a vehicle

## Informal warning

Before you download and use this software consider the following: you are interfering with your car and doing that with hardware and software beyond your control (and frankly, for a large part beyond ours), created by a loose team of interested amateurs in this field. Any car is a possibly lethal piece of machinery and you might hurt or kill yourself or others using it, or even paying attention to the displays instead of watching the road. Be extremely prudent!

By even downloading this software, or the source code provided on GitHub, you agree to have completely understood this.
